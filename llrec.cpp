/**
 * Given a linked list pointed to by head, creates two lists
 * where all values less than or equal to the pivot value are
 * placed in a linked list whose head will be pointed to by
 * smaller and all values greater than the pivot
 * value are placed in a linked list whose head will be pointed to
 * by larger.  The input list pointed to by head should be empty
 * upon return and head set to NULL (i.e. we are not making copies)
 * in the smaller and larger lists but simply moving Nodes out of
 * the input list and into the two other lists.
 * 
 * ==============================================================
 * MUST RUN IN O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the input list
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * @pre: smaller and larger may containing garbage (do NOT have
 *       to be NULL)
 *
 * @param[inout] head
 *   Reference to the head pointer to the input list.
 *   Should be set to NULL upon return
 * @param[out] smaller
 *   Reference to a head pointer for the list of nodes with values
 *   less than or equal to the pivot
 * @param[out] larger
 *   Reference to a head pointer for the list of nodes with values
 *   greater than the pivot
 * @param[in] pivot
 *   Pivot value
